# ML3_Fianl-Project_TsaiYunLi
In this project, my goal is to solve the Kaggle competition task, a multi-class classification problem, of predicting some BBC news article categories by training and comparing two models on the provided labelled news articles:
1. a none-deep learning hybrid model, TFIDF_LR = a term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer + a logistic regression (LR) classifier
2. and a deep learning hybrid model, TFIDF_ANN = an TF-IDF vectorizer + an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier

A vectorizer is necessary to preprocess the news article texts from strings to integers since machine learning models require numerical input. Among all the vectorizers, TF-IDF is chosen for its widespread use and availability as TfidfVectorizer in the sklearn library, and because that it is particularly suited to news article datasets where word frequency plays a crucial role in understanding context and facilitating categorization.

The choice to use both an LR classifier and an ANN classifier here stems from their ability to effectively handle vectorized text data. LR is simpler than ANN, faster to train, and can handle linearly speparable features well. However, ANN can handle complexer, non-linearly seperable features. Therefore, it is worth comparing both classifiers to see which performs better at this news category multi-class classification prediction task.

Results:
Both models have very similar, very good results from their classification report and confusion matrix. Thier overall accuracy is also very close: TFIDF_LR model has an overall accuracy of around 0.9675; while, TFIDF_ANN model has an overall accuracy of about 0.9799, slightly higher than the one for the TFIDF_LR model. TFIDF_LR model misclassified 1, 2, and 4 instances for sport, business, and politics categories, respectively. TFIDF_LR model misclassified 2 and 4 instances for business and politics categories, respectively. Their total number of misclassifications is significantly small for a total number of 1490*20%=298 news articles in the validation dataset X_val, y_val.

Since both the TFIDF_LR (overall accuracy 0.9675) and TFIDF_ANN models perform well on the valdation dataset (overall accuracy 0.9799), both models are used to predict the news categories in the unlabelled, unseen BBCtest_data. The predicted categories of the two models only differ on totally 11 out of 735 instances, i.e., about 1.5 % of the entire test data. Even though there is no answer set for the categorization result of this test data, I inspected one raw news article text each, along with their predicted categories from the two models, which seem to be correct. I believe that the TFIDF_LR and the TFIDF_ANN models do indeed perform well on the test data.

Please kindly point out what I have done wrong or what I can improve in this project! Please also do not use any code or text from this project without proper citation. Thank you!
